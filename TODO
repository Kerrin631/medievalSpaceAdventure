- objects will appear in the inventory and then disappear

- as I move through the story it will jump back and forth between my current position and some past position that I have already navigated past

- It seems like the server is running multiple instances and ever type I submit a command, it jumps between the multiple instances and picks up at some other location

- sometimes the story disappears entirely
